# Welcome to the Bird Watcher Tutorial

When the P3 was first announced, I was extremely excited about the possibility
of the platform. The P3 Sample App included with the SDK is a great starting
point for any app. However, it can be a little overwhelming, and hard to know
where to start.

The purpose of this tutorial is to document an example of writing a complete pinball game, from idea to
playable. Hopefully it will help explain some of the concepts of the platform,
Unity, and help you overcome the getting started roadblock.

## Why am I qualified to write this

**I'm not.**

But I know enough to be dangerous. I have worked as a professional software
developer for over 15 years, working on things from high performance databases,
mobile cryptography, applied machine learning, large scale distributed systems
and much more. I have a Bachelor of Computer Science and a Masters of Computer
Science.

When I started playing around with the SDK, I knew nothing about Unity, had
never used C# and had never used Windows as a development environment.

Over the last few years, I have started developing a few P3 games, and got them all to a
moderately playable state.

  * [Gammagoat Sample App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1meuSpv90E): A simple EM-inspired game
  * [Double Super Jackpot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk7M-LwTJ2A): An app I wrote to enter into the Buffalo Pinball
    theme song cover contest
  * [Arena (Codename)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yT2J2xh6IJg): A Rougelite card game.

## Prerequisites

I am not going to cover setting up your programming environment. This assumes
you have

  * Installed [Unity 5.6.7](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)
  * Registered at multimorphic.com and downloaded the 0.8 SDK. See [3P Developers Page](https://www.multimorphic.com/p3-pinball-platform/3rd-party-developers/)

    {: .note }
    Make sure you follow the SDK setup instructions and have copied your .multimorphic directory to your home directory

  * Optionally installed other programs that might be useful like git, vscode, blender, gimp.

## Recommended reading

  * It is a good idea as much as possible to follow [the Microsoft C# Coding convensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions). I do a terrible job at this, but it is a good idea to follow.
  
  * Read the SDK documentation. You should read it all. But at a minimum:

    * Introduction to the P3 Development Kit
    * Overview of the P3
    * Structure of a P3 App
