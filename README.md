# Bird Watcher Tutorial

## Welcome to the Bird Watcher Tutorial

When the P3 was first announced, I was extremely excited about the possibility of the platform. The P3 Sample App included with the SDK is a great starting point for any app. However, it can be a little overwhelming, and hard to know where to start.

The purpose of this tutorial is to document an example of writing a complete pinball game, from idea to playable. Hopefully it will help explain some of the concepts of the platform, Unity, and help you overcome the getting started roadblock.

I welcome corrections and contributions. If you are are comfortable making a PR, please send one and I will review and merge. Otherwise, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/Op3nPinball/BirdWatcherTutorial/issues/new)

## Code Examples

You are welcome to use any of this code in your own projects. I am working on getting the example code to a point I can check it into this repository, but right now it is too intertwined with the P3 Sample App. Hopefully I can get something figured out in the future.
